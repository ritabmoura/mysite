            <p>Iâ€™m focused on users and their experiences. Skilled in wireframing and protoyping at varying levels of fidelity. I also have some experience in front-end coding and actually enjoy it.</p>
            <p>I believe a designer should be fully involved in their projects, meaning their process is felt and translated into the final product. Such ideology underlies my own creative process and work development.</p>
